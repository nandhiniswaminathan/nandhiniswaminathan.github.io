                    Selected as one of 21 students and new graduates in the country to join the NIST laboratories of Boulder, Colorado. Operating within the Information Technology Laboratory, I developed quantum state tomography software to simulate qubit measurement by a computer. Our interdisciplinary group was predominantly theoretical and interested in maximizing the fidelity of qubit measurements without facilitating decoherence. My simulation experiments identified peculiar qubit behavior when measured under different purity and optimization methods. Collaboration with experimental groups to test our theories was common.

                    Data Science arm of Kroger stores. Developed and outlier detection system in SQL to programmatically parse incoming Controlled Store Test (CST) data for executional errors. CSTs allow Kroger and its consumer packaged goods (CPG) providers (P&G, Burt's Bees, etc.) to experiment with different store layouts and product packaging. These tests are difficult to conduct because holding extraneous variables constant is extremely difficult. My task was to validate testing data was suitable for further analysis and not greatly impacted by confounding factors. Ultimately, my solution ran in less than 30 seconds and detected over 85% of known executional issues historically, saving analysts 4 - 8 hours per test.

Mentored by PhD student John Kiernicki and worked to generate Rhodium and Iridium organo-metallic complexes by successfully attaching organic ligands to the structure. Metal-mediated organic transformations with f-block compounds, particularly those with low oxidation states, are difficult to conduct. Over the summer I was able to generate one Iridium crystal structure of adequate quality, and determine its resulting structure using H1 NMR (certified over summer), IR spectroscopy, and other diagnostic tests.

                            In reasoning about sequential events it is natural to pose probabilistic queries such as “when will event A occur next” or “what is the probability of A occurring before B,” with applications in areas such as user modeling, medicine, and finance. However, with machine learning shifting towards neural autoregressive models, probabilistic querying has been largely restricted to simple cases such as next-event prediction. In this paper we introduce a general typology for predictive queries in autoregressive sequence models and show that such queries can be systematically represented by sets of elementary building blocks.

                          When a large-scale crisis occurs, the most common destination for up-to-date information is social media, namely Twitter. As crises affect people, it is essential to extract and categorize all relevant information to ensure a thorough and swift response. However, there currently are no sequence tagging datasets for crisis reponse. We programmatically generate a proxy for this dataset with unilabeled tweets and data augmentation from <a href="https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/humaid_dataset.html" target="_blank">HumAID</a> and successfully build a lexically invariant sequence tagger.

                            Characterizing quantum bits (qubits) is an essential aspect of quantum computing and quantum information science because successful quantum computation requires high fidelity preparation, manipulation, and measurement of qubits. However, fully characterizing qubits with a single measurement is impossible. Therefore, quantum state tomography (QST) – estimating a quantum state using a collection of measurements of copies of that state – is necessary to characterize experimental quantum devices...

                        Machine learning robustness is central to ensuring we can trust intelligent, automated systems. Despite the huge advances in Machine and Reinforcement Learning, many of these systems still remain black box classifiers. Research in explainable AI (XAI) and ML robustness is ongoing, but largely has not been explored with Reinforcement Learning. CAMeLeon addresses this gap, allowing a user to examine RL agent competency in different environments.

                        <p align = 'left'>
                            Airbender is a meta-progamming tool that allows Data Scientists to quickly and effectively build high quality machine learning solutions. After receiving a configuration, Airflow writes a python code file that encapsulates all of the functionality in nodes and maps all relevant dependencies as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). With intelligent package detection, Airbender creates a file that is ready to compile in Airflow immediately, allowing users full transparency into and control of their experiments.

                        <p align = 'left'>
                            There are many examples on the internet of developers and Data Scientists utilizing Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies to teach the agents of simple computer games to play (Snake, Mario Bros., etc.). However, few of these implementations conduct such an experiment under adversarial circumstances, when multiple agents compete for limited resources. In this project I build, <b>from scratch</b>, an adversarial implementation of Neuroevolution for the game snake. For simplicity, topologies were fixed for all agents based on a common fitness function.

Using a transfer learning model build on the Xception classifier, myself and small team I led were able to achieve a holistic macro and micro F1 Score of 86% across all classes. We then integrated this model into a frontend Flask web application where a user can upload any photo and see the top 10 class prediction probabilities as well as the overall prediction.

The solution I completed was 98 percent accurate for classifying numbers.

This project allows the user to upload a text file (PDF support coming shortly!) and then generate a unique story with the style of the input authors. This process will include all punctuation and spacing is provided by the system, allowing for stylistic spacing like in poetry to be accommodated.

The player must grow in strength by roaming the map before he or she tackles each of the 8 academic buildings, unlocking the 9th and final building, the office of administration. Here, players come face to face with their strongest opponent yet, the University President. Download the .jar file and play today (no, this is not a virus)! See the presentation for more details on the functionality and dynamism of this game.

In cases of uncertainty, the solver will posit a guess and continue its execution. If it runs across an error, this guess is corrected or adjusted to accommodate the new information created. NOTE: This system is not yet perfect, and on rare occaisons (specifically when no input is provided), this solver will fail. Future development is forthcoming to patch this, but in the mean-time check out the list of sample puzzles provided. Before a cell is solved, it is color-coded and potential matches appear in the corners, just like how my Grandma solves them!
